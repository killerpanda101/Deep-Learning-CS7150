# CS 7150 programming assignment 1: Fully-Connected and Convolutional Neural Networks


# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). You are highly encouraged to use Python 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command, Modify the command based on your OS (`linux`, `mac`, or `win`): `conda env create -f pa1_env.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs7150_pa1'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs7150_pa1` in the Windows default Command Prompt or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs7150_pa1` or `source activate cs7150_pa1`
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook ./pa1_code/fc_cnn.ipynb`and finish tasks described over there.
5. Submit your finished Jupyter notebook files to Canvas.
