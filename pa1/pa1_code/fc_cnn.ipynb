    "# Programming assignment 1: Fully-Connected and Convolutional Neural Networks (100 points, excluding the extra credits)\n",
    "(adapted from the work done by Erik Learned-Miller, which was originally developed by Fei-Fei Li, Andrej Karpathy, and Justin Johnson)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "<font size='4'> In this assignment you will practice putting together implementations of a Fully-Connected Neural Network and a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) using a modular approach with `Python` and `Numpy`. For each layer we will implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. The `forward` function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a `cache` object storing data needed for the backward pass. Fully-connected networks are a good testbed for experimentation because they are very computationally efficient, but in practice all state-of-the-art results use convolutional networks instead. We will also explore different update rules for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission format\n",
    "* <font size='4'>`<your_nu_username>_fc_cnn.ipynb` with your implementations and output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Note: \n",
    "* <font size='4'>Do not install any additional packages inside the conda environment. The TAs will use the same environment as defined in the config file we provide you, so anything thatâ€™s not in there by default will probably cause your code to break during grading. Failure to follow any of these instructions will lead to point deductions. \n",

    "<font size='4'>Normally batch-normalization accepts inputs of shape `(N, D)` and produces outputs of shape `(N, D)`, where we normalize across the minibatch dimension `N`. For data coming from convolutional layers, batch normalization needs to accept inputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and produce outputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` where the `N` dimension gives the minibatch size and the `(H, W)` dimensions give the spatial size of the feature map.\n",

Since ResNet, such flattening is no longer used. Instead, an adaptive average pooing layer is used. Given a 2D feature map with shape of `(N, C, H, W)`, the mean across the dimension `H` and `W` are computed. As a result, we get a 2D feature map with shape of `(N, C, 1, 1)` that is equivalent to a 1D feature vector with shape of `(N, C)`."
